# Setting Up Ollama for Jarvis AI Assistant

To enable Jarvis to generate intelligent responses, you'll need to set up Ollama on your local machine. Follow these steps to get Ollama up and running.

## üöÄ Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Ollama**: Ollama is a powerful language model used for generating responses. You will need to install and configure it for this project.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1. **Install Ollama**

First, download and install Ollama on your local machine. Follow the instructions below:

- Visit the official [Ollama website](https://ollama.com/download) to download the installation package for your operating system.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to install Ollama.

### 2. **Run Ollama**

After installation, you need to start the Ollama server. Open a terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
ollama start
```

This will start the Ollama server on your machine, and it will be accessible at `http://localhost:11434`.

### 3. **Verify the Server**

Once Ollama is running, verify that the server is working by visiting the following URL in your browser:

```
http://localhost:11434
```

If the server is running correctly, you should see a confirmation message or a simple API response.

### 4. **Configure the Assistant Script**

In your Jarvis AI Assistant project, make sure the following line in your Python script is pointing to the correct Ollama server URL:

```python
ollama_host = "http://localhost:11434"
```

This ensures that your assistant can communicate with the Ollama server for generating responses.

## üìù Usage

Now that Ollama is set up and running, you can start interacting with your Jarvis AI Assistant. Just run the following command to start the assistant:

```bash
python local_jarvis.py
```

Your assistant will be ready to listen to your voice commands and generate responses using Ollama's powerful language model.
